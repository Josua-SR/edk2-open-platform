FdfFile poritng guide - FV size
-------------------------------

In order to set intended Firmware Volume size, user has to increase limit set in
platform Flash Description File (.fdf).
All changes should be made in [FD section].
Below is example for Armada7040 platforms.

Excerpt from OpenPlatformPkg/Platform/Marvell/Armada/Armada7040.fdf (for clarity
some comments were removed):

  [FD.Armada7040_EFI]
  BaseAddress   = 0x00000000|gArmTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFdBaseAddress
  Size          = 0x00b00000|gArmTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFdSize
  ErasePolarity = 1

  # This one is tricky, it must be: BlockSize * NumBlocks = Size
  BlockSize     = 0x00001000
  NumBlocks     = 0xb00

  0x00000000|0x00b00000
  gArmTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFvBaseAddress|gArmTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFvSize
  FV = FVMAIN_COMPACT

Assuming that Firmware Volume size should be at least 0xe00000 MB, following 3
changes should be made (marked with additional comments):

  [FD.Armada7040_EFI]
  BaseAddress   = 0x00000000|gArmTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFdBaseAddress
  Size          = 0x00e00000|gArmTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFdSize  ## <-- Here set new FV size limit
  ErasePolarity = 1

  # This one is tricky, it must be: BlockSize * NumBlocks = Size
  BlockSize     = 0x00001000
  NumBlocks     = 0xe00  ## <-- Ass in comment two lines above, edit NumBlocks
                         ## value regarding new size, such as
                         ## NumBlocks * BlockSize = Size

  0x00000000|0x00e00000 ## <-- Here set new FV size limit
  gArmTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFvBaseAddress|gArmTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFvSize
  FV = FVMAIN_COMPACT
