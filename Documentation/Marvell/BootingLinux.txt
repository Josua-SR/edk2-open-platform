Booting Linux from UEFI
-----------------------
In order to boot Linux from UEFI EFI_STUB is used. EFI_STUB is part of
Linux kernel that acts like UEFI application.

In order to boot linux from uefi:
 - Replace Platforms/Marvell/Armada7040/Binary/Image with linux Image file
 - Replace Platforms/Marvell/Armada7040/Binary/devicetree.dtb with dtb file
 - For above, names (Image and devicetree.dtb) should remain the same
 - Build UEFI according to Documentation/Marvell/Build.txt guide

NOTE: Firmware Volume size is limited by default to 11MB. If size of attached
kernel and dtb images will cause UEFI image to exceed this limit, user needs to
increase FV size. Please refer to Documentation/Marvell/PortingGuide/FdfFile.txt.

Usage
-----
Once UEFI is built from delivered branch, required Linux image and
DTB file are attached. To run, boot UEFI and execute:
fs1:
Linux.efi dtb=devicetree.dtb console=ttyS0,115200

Please note that in order to boot Linux psci must be disabled. It can be
achieved by removing / disabling psci DTS node.
